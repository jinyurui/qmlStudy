this pro about how to create qml plugin.

[process]
First, we need to inherit the QQmlExtensionPlugin class, which is an abstract base class that provides plugins for QML loading.

2. then we need to use the Q_PLUGIN_METADATA macro in its subclass to register its plugin to Qt's meta object system.

3. Rewrite the pure virtual function registerTypes() and use qmlRegisterType() to register the QML type in the plugin, which is the same as we did in the main function.

4. Then we need to write a plugin project file, including TEMPLATE, CONFIG, DESTDIR, TARGET, and so on.

5. Finally, we also need to create a qmldir file to describe the plugin.


[node][qmldir file desc] more can see "Module Definition qmldir Files" on QtHelp
module MyPlug                >>    as model to import.This is [moduleName]
QmlTest 1.0 QmlTest.qml      >>    qml part
plugin GenericPlugin         >>    the lib name ,c++ part , as plugin to create, then you can use item name on qml.

[node][pro file]
TEMPLATE = lib
CONFIG += plugin


[how to use]
1. build pro, then copy *.dll + *.qmldir to "you use pathDir/[moduleName]/"
2. create new app, addImportPath("you use pathDir/")
3. import [moduleName],then you can use you speitem.
